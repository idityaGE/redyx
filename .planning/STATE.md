**Core value:** Users can anonymously create communities, post content, and have threaded discussions — with minimal personal data collected and maximum privacy preserved.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation + Frontend Shell

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 7 (Foundation + Frontend Shell) — COMPLETE
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase — all plans completed
Status: Phase 1 Complete — ready for Phase 2 planning
Last activity: 2026-03-02 — Completed 01-03: Platform libs + Docker Compose + Envoy transcoding

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 14%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 3
- Average duration: ~12 min
- Total execution time: ~0.6 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-foundation-frontend-shell | 3/3 | ~35 min | ~12 min |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 7-phase structure following strict dependency order (foundation → auth → content → comments → engagement → safety → deployment)
- [Roadmap]: Frontend built progressively — Astro+Svelte project initialized in Phase 1, each subsequent phase builds corresponding frontend pages alongside backend services
- [Roadmap]: Phase 7 is deployment + observability only (no frontend feature work, only performance optimization via FEND-04)
- [Roadmap]: ScyllaDB comment schema deferred to Phase 4 — design before coding, schema is irreversible
- [Roadmap]: Home feed cross-shard aggregation is in Phase 3 — hardest feature, needs research spike during planning
- [Roadmap]: Rate limiting placed in Phase 2 with auth (Envoy-level enforcement)
- [01-02]: TailwindCSS v4 CSS-first config with @theme directive, not tailwind.config.js
- [01-02]: JetBrains Mono via Bunny Fonts CDN (privacy-friendly)
- [01-02]: Dark mode default, inline script in head prevents flash
- [01-02]: Svelte 5 runes ($state, $derived) for all interactive components
- [01-01]: buf.gen.yaml uses per-file go_package override for googleapis to resolve import path
- [01-01]: Generated Go code committed to gen/ (not gitignored) per architecture decision
- [01-01]: Health proto renamed to CheckRequest/CheckResponse for buf STANDARD lint compliance
- [01-03]: Envoy match_incoming_request_route: true for REST path routing (Pitfall 2 prevention)
- [01-03]: preserve_proto_field_names: false — camelCase JSON everywhere (Pitfall 1)
- [01-03]: Platform libs in internal/platform/ with grpcserver bootstrap, config, database, redis, middleware, errors, pagination
- [01-03]: Middleware chain order: Recovery → Logging → ErrorMapping (outermost catches panics)
- [01-03]: Error mapping interceptor sanitizes internal errors — never leaks raw messages to clients

### Context from Init

- Extensive upfront design exists: SRS, architecture plan, 45 user stories, UML diagrams
- Tech stack locked: Go + gRPC + Envoy + Astro/Svelte + PostgreSQL + ScyllaDB + Redis + Kafka + Meilisearch + S3
- Database-per-service pattern with application-level sharding on post service
- Privacy/anonymity is a core architectural constraint, not a feature toggle

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Home feed aggregation strategy not yet decided (fan-out-on-write vs fan-out-on-read) — needs Phase 3 research
- ScyllaDB migration tooling gap — no standard tool, needs custom version tracking
- Envoy rate limiting integration approach (local vs external) — needs Phase 2 implementation research
- Post shard count (2 vs 4 for v1) — affects consistent hash ring, decide during Phase 3 planning
